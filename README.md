## The OpenWeb Template Engine

OpenWeb provides a very basic syntax for integrating HTML and PHP (i.e. a template engine). It provides basic functions such as variable assignment and file-based cache. It introduces the "OpenWeb Syntax".

This repo provides a place to put the engine available for anyone else to use, fork or fix. The OpenWeb engine will serve as the primary template engine for all my future projects, and you are more than welcome to use it for yours.
